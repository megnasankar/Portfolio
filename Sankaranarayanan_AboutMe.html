                        <p class="float right"> I am Megna Sankaranarayanan, class of 2022 from Dublin High School. Medicine is a topic that I am most interested in, and I aspire to become a neurosurgeon. To achieve this goal, I plan on attending 4 years of undergraduate school, then 4 years of medical school, after which I would take residency courses. Even though this would take extensive time and dedication, I am ready to do this because I am greatly interested in math and science, specifically medicine. I find a surgeon to be a well fitted job for me as it involves both practical usage of medicine (surgeries) and research as well.</p>
                        <p> I have many skills that are applicable to this career. These include my responsibility, as seen by my projects. Always, I make sure to finish the work and ensure that a lot of detail is incorporated. This also highlights my skills of precision and determination. My determination is also showed by my active involvement in Taekwondo.</p>
                        <p> My major achievements in school include getting the award of "Academic Excellence" in Fallon Middle School, signifying that I had a 4.0 gpa for all quarters, in all 3 years of middle school. I am in the HOSA organization, as well as the Pre-med Society club. I also do Taekwondo, in which I have a 2nd degree Black Belt. I continue to do taekwondo to get my 3rd degree. Taking harder classes in lower grades, such as completing Honors Chemistry in 9th grade, finishing Algebra 1 over the summer of 7th-8th grade, and taking Advanced English 9, have showed me that I am capable of doing well in rigorous courses.</p>
                        <p> With my different qualities, I am constantly working to achieve my goal, and improve my skill-set. Thanks for reading about me! Explore the rest of this website to see more about me, my work experiences, my projects, and much more!</p>
