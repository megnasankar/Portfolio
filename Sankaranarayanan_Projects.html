                        <h6> <strong> Course: </strong> Biology, Dublin High School </h6> 
                        <h6> <strong> Date: </strong> Taken at DPIE over the summer of 2018: June 5th to July 13th</h6>
                        <p> <strong> About the Project: </strong> The objective of this project was to complete a science project or an engineering project, for a science fair display. My partner and I chose to complete an engineering project, with the purpose of creating a prototype of an Air Conditioning System that automatically works, even when the car is turned off, in case there is a human inside the car and the temperature reaches too high. My partner and I shared all works of this project, including the documentations and the building of the actual prototype. Through the project, I learned how to properly document my work for the first time. I did background research, created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11mPVpNWq-aQkIVwrCAMyz-iN0Wr3ChwJ6tyBrYm7wy4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> report document</a>, and I wrote an  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XclA5OStjCn6spdvMFn9WhjSGi6bDY4Y8KdTxa0Mkqk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> abstract</a>. I also learned how to code using Mindstorms software, to create a working machine with gears. I also practiced my skill of communication, so that my partner and I could properly present to the judges during the fair. In the project, there were some coding problems that my partner and I had to overcome, as the temperature sensor coding was difficult to write. However, by using different sources and by experimenting, my partner and I were able to overcome this problem. The project clearly highlighted my teamwork and leadership skills as well. I easily collaborated with my partner so that the project work got done as efficiently as possible. I mainly communicated to our teacher about our projects, showing my leadership skills. </p>
