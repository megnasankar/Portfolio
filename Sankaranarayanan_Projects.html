                        <h6> <strong> Course: </strong> Biology, Dublin High School </h6> 
                        <h6> <strong> Date: </strong> Taken at DPIE over the summer 
                        of 2018: June 5th to July 13th</h6>
                        <p style="font-size: 18px"> <strong> About the Project: </strong> The objective 
                        of this project was to complete a science project or an 
                        engineering project, for a science fair display. My partner 
                        and I chose to complete an engineering project, with the 
                        purpose of creating a prototype of an Air Conditioning 
                        System that automatically works, even when the car is 
                        turned off, in case there is a human inside the car and 
                        the temperature reaches too high. My partner and I shared 
                        all works of this project, including the documentations 
                        and the building of the actual prototype. Through the 
                        project, I learned how to properly document my work for 
                        the first time. I did background research, created a 
                        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xXLIaQRxMkU4a7ZLBMW-prkCGYTkksMxInSbjUxs99w/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> report document</a>, 
                        and I wrote an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vwhRZ5hNtq_j5nHNaLqfBCMuWGg_cbn1kB1S5bsgmuM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> abstract</a>. 
                        I also learned how to code using Mindstorms software, to 
                        create a working machine with gears. I also practiced my 
                        skill of communication, so that my partner and I could 
                        properly present to the judges during the fair. In the 
                        project, there were some coding problems that my partner 
                        and I had to overcome, as the temperature sensor coding 
                        was difficult to write. However, by using different sources 
                        and by experimenting, my partner and I were able to overcome 
                        this problem. The project clearly highlighted my teamwork 
                        and leadership skills as well. I easily collaborated with 
                        my partner so that the project work got done as efficiently 
                        as possible. I mainly communicated to our teacher about 
                        our projects, showing my leadership skills.

                        <p style="font-size: 18px"> <strong> About the Project: </strong> The objective 
                        of this project was to modify a game and create a better,
                        more user-friendly version, making an app using the MIT 
                        App inventor software. My partner and I chose a game 
                        called “Oh My Spikes”, where the user taps the screen 
                        in order to make the bird jump in the air, and to 
                        successfully take the bird to the other side of the 
                        screen without hitting any obstacles. We modified this 
                        game to make the bird fly smoother, add more obstacles, 
                        and add a power function. My partner and I shared all 
                        works of this project, including the documentations and 
                        the making of the app. We took turns being the driver 
                        (instructs which blocks to use) and coder (uses the blocks). 
                        In this project, I learned to properly comment my work. 
                        I added detailed comments for each block to explain their 
                        functions. Also, I improved my documenting skills, and 
                        made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j0YZEgJ-gDtBWneWUfe3uYvlU8lrX5dLAzMkJkiotiY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> research document</a>. 
                        In the project, there were 
                        some coding problems that my partner and I had to overcome, 
                        as there was a constant glitch in the obstacles, which 
                        kept disappearing and reappearing. However, my partner 
                        and I were able to solve this problem when we looked into 
                        the code deeper. The project highlighted my teamwork and 
                        leadership skills as well. I easily collaborated with
                        my partner so that the project work got done as efficiently 
                        as possible. I took charge of the documentation and turning 
                        it it, showing my leadership skills.

                        objective of this project was to modify images to suit a 
                        chosen client’s needs. My partner and I chose to modify 
                        our images to fit a Family Client’s needs. We used python 
                        manipulations in order to give different options to our 
                        users when modifying their pictures -  we gave different 
                        color options, and different frame border options (see 
                        picture to the side). My partner and I shared all works 
                        of this project, including the documentations and the 
                        coding. I added many comments throughout the codes, and 
                        updated the daily log with good detail. This helped me 
                        learn how to properly log my progress with detail. Also, 
                        I greatly improved my documenting skills, making a 
                        professional looking <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19kBGaFO4XYzlC7lR_UWz5QnRHV7LoRhEh_1tDUirJOY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> research document</a>. We 
                        encountered a problem in the project. Our raw-input 
                        function did not work the way we wanted it to, 
                        originally. However, through trial and error in the code, 
                        we were able to solve this problem. The project highlighted 
                        my teamwork and leadership skills as well. I easily
